SerIR is an educational abstraction app of Infrared signals captured from human and Television interaction to talk about possible cybersecurity risks, such as:

 - **IR Keylogging**;
 - **IR Tracking and Behavioral Profiling**;
 - **IR payload injection**.

## Getting started

### How?

When you are in front of your TV holding the controller and pressing any button, a signal will travel from you to the television. Am I correct? This project uses a hardware and software combination to allow you to capture and store those signals.

### Hardware

Hardware inventory: 
 - O1 NEC Infrared Codec Module (ver1.0) (YS-IRTM);
 - 02 BT-05 Bluetooth modules;
 - O1 CP2120 Module USB to TTL.
 - LG Model 43LM6300PSB ~ 50/60 Hz 68 W ~ Software version 05.40.45

#### Characteristics

 - 38khz InfraRed encoder(transmitter) and decoder (receiver);
 - Infrared Head Extension (scalability); 
 - UART Microcontroller Serial Communication Interface;
 - Bluetooth communication.

### The software

A virtual/real keyboard is or looks like a matrix. I/We have learned how to abstract it using a programming language. In this case, Golang. For example, the next table represents a multidimensional [4][10] array. 

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| q | w | e | r | t | y | u | i | o | p |
| a | s | d | f | `g` | h | j | k | l | รง |
| z | x | c | v | b | n | m | , | . | ; |

The algorithm interacts with the sent IR signals, captured by the IR module, and replays the "movements". Every virtual keyboard has an initial/start point. This test's starting point was **g** or index [2,4].   

**Example - LG TV KEYBOARD MAPPING**

</p>

The following code represents the basic characters observed on the last image (TV input). 

```
keyboard := [4][10]string{{"1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0"}, {"q", "w", "e", "r", "t", "y
", "u", "i", "o", "p"}, {"a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "?"}, {"@", "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", "m",
 ",", "."}}
```
### IR Keylogging

In this scenario, We'll talk about infrared keyloggers. As We know, the keylogger is an evil app created to record keyboard inputs. There are a lot of ways to do it, it depends on each scenario. In our case, we are capturing IR signals. 

Steps:

 - Putting the hardware in place. (Put it on very close to the TV sensor);
 - On TV, go to a keyboard interaction. For example, a browser or another textbox interaction;
 - It is time to start the serIR;
